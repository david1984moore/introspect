## Quick Reference

This document establishes foundational design principles for Introspect V3. Full content archived.

**Key Principles:**
- Single-track architecture with intelligent adaptation
- 100% information requirement (all categories mandatory)
- SCOPE.md-driven orchestration (14 required sections)
- Multiple choice is standard, text input is exception
- Feature selection is atomic (one screen, no follow-ups)

**Core Mission:**
Transform unstructured client conversations into complete technical specifications through intelligent orchestration, generating both SCOPE.md (for Cursor AI) and client PDF.
